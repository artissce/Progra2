# Programming 2 - C++ Assignments

This repository contains my personal assignments and practice exercises for the **Programming 2** course. The projects were developed in **C++**, focusing on file handling, pointers, and data structures like structs.

## Topics Covered

- Basic and advanced C++ syntax
- Functions and recursion
- Structures (`struct`)
- Pointers and dynamic memory management
- File handling (reading/writing `.txt` and binary files)
- Modular code using multiple files

## Contents

- `src/` – Source code for assignments and exercises
- `data/` – Sample input/output files used for testing
- `docs/` – Optional notes or documentation

## Requirements

- C++ Compiler (g++, clang++, etc.)
- Code editor or IDE (Visual Studio Code, Code::Blocks, etc.)

## Disclaimer
These are student projects developed as part of my learning experience in the Programming 2 course. Code quality may vary across files.
